# *Chem*istry *e*lectronic note*pad*

The *Chem*istry *e*lectronic note*pad* (eChempad) platform is a suite of web microservices oriented to manage the entire
data life-cycle of experiments and assays from **Experimental Chemistry** and related Science disciplines.

The eChempad platform appears as an answer to the digitization needs of experimental chemists at [Institut Català 
d'Investigació Química (ICIQ)](https://www.iciq.org/). This platform intends to be an analogous example of the 
successful platform for **Computational Chemistry** also developed at ICIQ:
([ioChem-BD platform](https://www.iochem-bd.org/index-introduction.jsp). 

The current project holds all necessary source files and data to build and bundle distributable copies of the eChempad 
platform.
