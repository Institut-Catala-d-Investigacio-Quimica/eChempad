### Run some code before ZK loader instantiates any component
[Page_Initialization](https://www.zkoss.org/wiki/ZK_Developer's_Reference/UI_Patterns/Page_Initialization)

To do so, you can use the tag `<?init class=org.my.path.MyClass?>` in the `.zul` class `MyClass`. `MyClass` must 
implement the interface Initiator / InitiatorExt and implement the method `void doInit(page page, Map map);`.

In this manner we can communicate with the frontend page and write and read variables from it from Java like this:
```
// To save a list of customers in the customer variable of the page
page.setAttribute(name != null ? name: "customers", CustomerManager.findAll());
```

### Compose UI using components
The [Include Directive](https://www.zkoss.org/wiki/ZK_Component_Reference/Essential_Components/Include) is used to 
include the output generated by another servlet. The servlet could be anything including JSF, JSP and even another ZUML 
page.

There are two ways to include another ZUML document: `instant` and `defer`. The default is `auto`
